ow what or who am I? As soon as this blog template posed that question the following exchange from the first Avengers film played back in my head.

>**Steve Rogers** : Big man in a suit of armour. Take that off and what are you?
>**Tony Stark** : Billionaire, Genius, Playboy, Philanthropist

Gotta admire the confidence of someone who can rattle off a list of on-point adjectives to answer what’s essentially the question the “about” page of a blog template asks.

Now I do not qualify for any of the above adjectives Mr Homo Ferrum used there. Although I do know that if I could be any Avenger, I’d choose to be Cap.
